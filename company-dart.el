;; Dart completion will be invoked only after the "." character has been typed.
;; For this to work company-minimum-prefix-length should be set to 0. If that
;; is inconvenient you can manually invoke completion by binding (company-dart)
;; to any key you like.  Includes an almighty hack (sleep-for). Removing this
;; will need modification in company-mode (??).
